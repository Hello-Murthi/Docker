What is Docker?

* Docker is an OS level virtualization
* Docker manages it's containers OS level activities with Hardware
* It's not OS but does all OS things with Hardware
* Docker utilizes kernel to do all

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advantages:

1. Memory:
	
	* Doesn't require much memory, there is no concept of OS
	* If you assign 10 GB for a container, it gives remaining 5 GB for host OS

2. Performance:

	* No unnecessary usage of resources
	* Hardware -> Host OS -> Docker Engine -> Containers

3. Portability:

	* Build images and create any no. of containers, anywhere

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main Purpose of Docker?

* Is to Package, Containerize apps, ship and run anywhere, anytime, as many times as we want with less resource consumptions

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Docker Container?

* Is a light weight software package that includes all dependencies (libraries/binaries) required to execute Apps

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you enter a command for Docker client, it sends to Docker Daemon via REST APIs, Daemon takes care of rest

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker Host?

* Here docker Daemon and containers present

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dockerfile -> images -> containers

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker compose?

* Let's say container 1 has Apache Websever, container 2 has SQL, but i need both, so i dont need to execure those 2 containers, directly i can compose both and make it use

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker Swarm?

* Orchastration to scale docker containers and make high availability

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker swarm has nodes, each node has it's own docker engine

* Manager Node
* Worker Node

Manager node, manages worker nodes
